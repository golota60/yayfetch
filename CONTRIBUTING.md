# Hey ðŸ‘‹!
Thanks for looking here. Contributions are welcome! If you've got any questions when it comes to setup(or the project overall), feel free to open an issue/start a discussion


# Running the project
We're using pnpm instead of npm, so make sure you've got it installed(`npm install -g pnpm`).

1. Clone the repository
2. run `pnpm install` in the root directory of the project
3. run `pnpm start <flags>` to run the project
