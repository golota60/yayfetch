## What is yayfetch?

Yayfetch is a tool similar to screenfetch - except you can use it on a non-linux machine via npx/npm

## Usage

**Note: It is NOT reccomended to install the package globally, because it is subject to often changes**

```npx yayfetch``` - returns info about your system

```npx yayfetch -p``` - first asks you what information you want to display, then displays it

More features to come!

## It doesn't work!

If it doesn't work for you make sure that you have the newest node(it's developed using node 12.13.0)
  
If you came here because of the ```'Error - check https://www.npmjs.com/package/yayfetch for more'``` error, then most likely the software just can't detect the information. Why? Because of the system you use. It may not work when:

1. You're using linux subsystem for windows
2. Your system is within virtual machine
